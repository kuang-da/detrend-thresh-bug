# Introduction

We may find a potential issue in `autothresholdr::mean_stack_thresh` function. To reproduce the error, `docker-compose build` to create the docker image. `docker-compose up` to start the RStudio Server. Then run the `main.R` in the RStudio Server. One would observe a session abort error. We also see this error in the PC of our lab in the microscope room.
